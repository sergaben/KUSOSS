# KUSOSS

Kingston University Social Online Space for Students.
This project was thought to be a tool to allow students to share their ideas and knowledge with peers that were doing the same degree as them.

## This project is composed of two main parts: The front-end and the back-end of the project

In the Front-end you can find the GUI of the project which was build using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)

In the Backend you can find the processes and services used to populate the GUI. To build the backend the chosen language was [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)

To store the data generated by the user, the chosen technology was [PosgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
